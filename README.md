# Simulating a queueing system using Python Simpy

## Why we need a Queque Simulation?
We all have been in a queueing sytem before (i.e., waiting a ridiculously long time in line at the security, movie theater, restaurant, or the bank). Have you ever thought to yourself, "It would be so cool if I know how much times it will take waiting in line so that I can plan ahead"? Well, the good news is that if we know the distribution of each waiting point in the queque, we can find much time it will take waiting in line using the magic of ***Computer Science*** and ***Statistics***! 

## About the Simulation:
I created a simple queque simulation for a restaurant using Python's library Simpy. The three main metrics for the simulation model are the distribution of incoming customer, the time it takes to order the food, and the time it takes to cook the food. By trying different model distributions and different combination of number of cashiers and cooks, we can find the average customer wait time.
